# MMMTweaks

[![Build](https://github.com/mediamonks/MMMTweaks/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mediamonks/MMMTweaks/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild)

Swift support for Facebook's Tweaks library.

(This is a part of `MMMTemple` suite of iOS libraries we use at [MediaMonks](https://www.mediamonks.com/).)

## Quick example

We're trying to keep the spirit of super convenience Tweak's ObjC macros. 

```swift
import MMMTweaks

// On startup:
#if DEBUG // Or any other condition when you want to have Tweaks enabled.
MMMTweaks.register()
#endif

// Anywhere in your code, but better closer to the use site:
extension MMMTweaks {
    @objc static var shouldMockCookies: BoolTweak = {
        return BoolTweak(path: .init("Test", "Mocks", "Mock cookies"), defaultValue: false)
    }()
}

// Use site:
if MMMTweaks.shouldMockCookies.isOn {
    // ...
}
```

Both the original Tweaks library and this Swift shim are by default enabled whenever `DEBUG` macro and `DEBUG` Swift active compilation conditions are correspondinly defined in their targets. 

To enable both libraries in configs where `DEBUG` is not defined you would need to define `FB_TWEAK_ENABLED` macro as `1` for Tweaks and add `FB_TWEAK_ENABLED` active compilation condition for MMMTweaks.

For example, you can enable both libs for non-Debug configs of your choice via a postinstall script in your Podfile:

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
        target.build_configurations.each do |config|
            if (target.name == "MMMTweaks" || target.name == "Tweaks") && (config.name == "<YourSpecialConfig>")
                config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= ['$(inherited)']
                config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] << 'FB_TWEAK_ENABLED=1'
                config.build_settings['SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS'] ||= ['$(inherited)']
                config.build_settings['SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS'] << 'FB_TWEAK_ENABLED'
            end
        end
    end
end
```
